 
THE VULNERABLE STATE OF YAMUNA RIVER 
 
OBJECTIVES 
 
●THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH IS TO STUDY AND DETECT THE VARIATIONS IN THE 
POLLUTANT CONCENTRATION OF THE WATER FOUND IN THE YAMUNA  THE HINDON 
RIVER
●TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF POLICYMAKERS  STAKEHOLDERS OF  INDIA
●TO MAKE THE CITIZENS AWARE ABOUT THE VARIOUS POLICIES  SCHEMES ADOPTED BY 
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT OF  INDIA REGARDING PREVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL 
POLLUTION
●TO CRITICALLY ANALYSE THE WORKING OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO 
CONTROLLING RIVER POLLUTION
INTRODUCTION 
 
THE YAMUNA​ IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RIVERS OF INDIA
AT TIMES IT WAS 
THE LIFELINE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA BUT TODAY IT IS THE MOST POLLUTED RIVER 
OF THE COUNTRY AND THE PART OF THE CRITICALLY POLLUTED STRETCH
RIVER ORIGINATES 
FROM YAMUNOTRI AT UTTARAKHAND  PASSES THROUGH HARYANA DELHI AND UTTAR 
PRADESH
IT MERGES WITH THE GANGA AT ALLAHABAD IN UTTAR PRADESH
THE TOTAL 
LENGTH OF YAMUNA IS 1376 KILOMETRES 855 MI AND HAS A​ DRAINAGE SYSTEM​ OF 
366223 SQUARE KILOMETRES
ACCORDING TO THE MILLENNIUM ECOSYSTEM ASSESSMENT THE BIODIVERSITY OF 
FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS HAS BEEN DEGRADED MORE THAN ANY OTHER ECOSYSTEM 
INCLUDING TROPICAL RAINFORESTS NEMA 2007
WATER POLLUTION IS A SERIOUS 
PROBLEM IN INDIA AS ALMOST 70 PER CENT OF ITS SURFACE WATER RESOURCES ARE 
CONTAMINATED BY BIOLOGICAL TOXIC ORGANIC AND INORGANIC POLLUTANTS

IN 1995 THE CENTRAL POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD CPCB IDENTIFIED SEVERELY 
POLLUTED STRETCHES ON 18 MAJOR RIVERS IN INDIA
NOT SURPRISINGLY A MAJORITY OF 
THESE STRETCHES WERE FOUND IN AND AROUND LARGE URBAN AREAS
THE HIGH 
INCIDENCE OF SEVERE CONTAMINATION NEAR URBAN AREAS INDICATES THAT THE 
INDUSTRIAL AND DOMESTIC SECTORS’ CONTRIBUTION TO WATER POLLUTION IS VERY HIGH
“SURPRISINGLY THOUGH DELHI CONSTITUTES ONLY 2 OF THE CATCHMENT AREA IT IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR 80 OF THE POLLUTION OF THE RIVERS” 
 
 
 
THUS HERE WE HAVE COMPILED A REPORT ON THE CURRENT POLLUTION SCENARIO OF 
THE RIVERS YAMUNA  HINDON WHICH PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FULFILLING THE 
NEEDS OF THE CITIZENS OF DELHI  ITS SURROUNDING AREAS
ALONG WITH THIS WE 
HAVE ALSO CRITICALLY ANALYSED THE WORKING  STEPS BEING TAKEN BY THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT IN LIMITING THE POLLUTION LEVELS AND HAVE JOTTED DOWN THE 
PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT EVERYONE MUST FOLLOW IN ORDER TO PUT A CHECK ON THE 
WASTAGE AND DEGRADATION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES
BACKGROUND SURVEY 
 
 
IN ORDER TO COLLECT INFORMATION AND GAIN A PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE TO ANALYSE 
ABOUT THE CURRENT STANDARDS OF POLLUTION IN THE YAMUNA AND HINDON RIVERS WHICH 
FLOW THROUGH THE DELHI NCR REGION WE VISITED  
●BANKS OF  YAMUNA RIVER AT AGRA
●BANKS OF  HINDON RIVER AT GHAZIABAD
WE TRIED TO LOOK AROUND THE PLACES NEAR THE BANKS TO FIND ANY INDUSTRY WHICH IS 
DISPOSING OFF ITS SEWAGE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE IN THE RIVER BODY AND ALSO 
PAGE 1 BREAK
INTERROGATED THE LOCALS AROUND IT REGARDING THE CHANGING STATE OF THE RIVER AND THE 
REASONS FOR THE CHANGE ACCORDING TO THEM
HERE IS THE FULL SUMMARY OF THE SURVEY THAT WE TOOK
➢THE THE WATER WAS REALLY SHALLOW AND THE FLOW WAS NEARLY DEAD
ESPECIALLY 
THE AREA WHERE WASHERMEN WERE WASHING CLOTHES THE WATER WAS FROTHY AND 
GREY
➢WHEN WE INVESTIGATED ABOUT THE BLACK WATER WE FOUND THE MATHURA OIL 
REFINERY A BIG CULPRIT
TRACES OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS WHICH ARE BELIEVED 
TO BE CARCINOGENIC FOUND
