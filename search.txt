      POP CULTURE  ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA
CELEBRITY WORSHIP AS A PART OF POPULAR CULTURE
        CELEBRITY WORSHIP IS A HIGHLEVEL CONTINUATION OF CELEBRITIES PERSONAL LIVES ON A GLOBAL 
SCALEIT IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER INTERESTS WHERE CELEBRITIES CONVERT THEIR 
FAME TO BECOME PRODUCT BRANDS
CELEBRITY  POLITICAL CULTURE
THERE  HAS  BEEN  A  BIG  OVERLAP  BETWEEN  CELEBRITY  AND  POLITICAL  CULTURE
THIS  IS  A 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE HUGE PLATFORM GIVEN TO 
A NATIONALLY UNIFYING FACTOR AMONG ALL SOCIAL GROUPS
THIS UNIFICATION AND HUGE PLATFORM 
PROVIDED BY CELEBRITIES HAS BEEN A POINT OF INTEREST FOR POLITICAL LEADERS AND GROUPS TO 
GAIN FARTHER REACH WITHIN VARIOU
ACQUIRE A CELEBRITY IMAGE OR TO CONNECT THEMSELVES WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO OWN THIS 
STATUS
THIS CAN BE SEEN WITH CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU WHO HAS BECOME 
TO SOME EXTENT A CELEBRITY BECAUSE O
DEVELOPING AND LIBERAL POLICIES
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS KATY PERRY CAMPAIGNING 
AND PERFORMING FOR HILLARY CLINTON DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU

SOCIAL MEDIA 
CELEBRITY CULTURE IS A CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING TOPIC THAT PROGRESS AS TECHNOLOGY DOES
DISTINCT PLATFORMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM SNAPCHAT AND ALL OF WHICH 
PROVIDE A NEW MARKET FOR CELEBRITIES TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR IDEAS
TWITTER IS REGULARLY 
CHANGING CELEBRITY IDEAS AND PROVIDES AN UNREGULATED SPACE FOR IDEAS TO BE SHARED
IT GIVES 
A PLATFORM FOR CELEBRITIES TO RESHARE THEIR IDEAS
IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR PEOPLE TO COMMENT 
MAKING IT ENGAGING TO FANS AND FOLLOWERS
INSTAGRAM IS ALSO CONTINUES TO BE A POPULAR 
MARKET FOR CELEBRITIES AS IT PROVIDES AN MARKET FOR PURELY PICTURES
MANY OF THESE PICTURES 
ALSO INCLUDE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE POPULAR IMPROVING THEIR IMAGE AND REACHING TO DISTINCT 
FAN BASES
LASTLY FACEBOOK IS STILL A FREQUENT USED PLATFORM THAT MANY CELEBRITIES USE
TODAY CELEBRITY RULES OUR WORLD
POLITICS ITSELF HAS BECOME AN EXERCISE IN PERFORMANCE
IT 
IS  AN  ADDICTIVE  DISORDER  IN  WHICH  A  PERSON  BECOMES  EXCESSIVELY  INVOLVED  WITH  THE 
CHARACTERISTICS OF A CELEBRITY LIFE
MANY PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED OVER POPULAR CULTURE FACTORS 
SUCH AS MAGAZINES FILMS  OR FASHION TRENDS
THIS CAN BE VERY DESTRUCTIVE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO TRY TO FOLLOW THEIR FAVORITE CELEBRITIES OR POP STARS
SECOND MOST CELEBRITIES SERVE AS BOTH AN OBJECT OF HATRED WHICH SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SEE 
AND DISLIKE THEM AND ALSO OF WORSHIP FOR THOSE WHO ARE OBSESSED WITH THEM
HENCE THESE 
CELEBRITIES REPRESENT WHAT WE ENDEAVOUR TO BE AND YET WHAT WE HATE MOST ABOUT 
OURSELVES AND BY OUR SOCIETY
I COULD SAY SOME OF THEM SET THE WRONG STANDARD OF BEAUTY OR 
ACQUIREMENT FOR MANY OF US
THEY MOTIVATE YOUNG CHILDREN TO BE “BEAUTIFUL” IN THE WRONG 
WAY
IN ADDITION THEY HAVE CREATED A NEW STANDARD THAT AFFECTS MANY YOUNG CHILDREN
NEVERTHELESS MANY PEOPLE STILL WORSHIP THEM AND STILL COPY WHAT THEY DO OR WHAT THEY 
WEAR
I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO COPY THEIR FAVORITE CELEBRITIES ARE PEOPLE OF 
YOUNG AGE RATHER THAN ADULTS
PAGE 2 BREAK
       THERE IS REALITY WHAT IS SHOWN TO PEOPLE IN SOCIAL M
ONLINE SITES USED TO SHOW THE BODY OF CELEBRITIES 
ACTUALLY BEHIND THE SCENE
SOME CELEBRITIES HA
PROMOTE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
THE WRONG WAY OF DIET IS ALWAYS IS ALWAYS BEING PROMOTED 
AND MANY YOUNGSTERS FEEL PRESSURIZED IN LOOKING LIKE THE CELEBRITIES
MANY YOUNGSTERS 
SET THEIR GOAL TO JUST BECOME RICH AND FAMOUS
THERE ARE VERY LESS PEOPLE WHO BECOME 
SUCCESSFUL IN THESE INDUSTRIES
REAL LIFE STRUGGLES ARE NEVER SHOWN IN MEDIA COVERAGE 
WHICH GIVES VERY UNREALISTIC PERSPECTIVE
AS A RESULT THE INFLUENCES OF CELEBRITIES AS A GOD HAVE BOTH ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS 
DISADVANTAGES  REGARDLESS  OF  TH

MEDIA AS SOURCES OF POP CULTURE 
   MEDIA PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROMOTING SPREADING AD SHAPING POPULAR CULTURE
WHETHER IT IS TRADITIONAL MEDIA OR NEW MEDIA BOTH PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE AS A SOURCE OF 
POPULAR CULTURE 
ADVERTISEMENTS AND POPULAR CULTURE 
ADVERTISEMENTS SHOWN THROUGH DIFFERENT MEDIA SUCH AS THE INTERNET TELEPHONE 
PRINT MEDIA POSTAL SYSTEM TELEVISION RADIO PLAY A GREAT ROLE IN PROMOTING AND SHAPING 
POPULAR CULTURE
ADVERTISEMENTS ARE A GREAT WAY TO PROMOTE ABOUT A PRODUCT SHOW OR 
UPCOMING EVENT ETC SO THAT PEOPLE GET TO KNOW ABOUT IT
WHEN PRODUCTS PROMOTED BY CELEBRITIES IN ADDS TEND TO BECOME TRENDY AND PEOPLE TEND TO 
USE THEM SINCE IT IS “POPULAR” FOR EXAMPLE VIRAT KOHLI AND ANUSHKA SHARMA PROMOTING 
MANYAVAR BRAND ALIA BHATT PROMOTING CAPRESE BAGS AND MAKEMYTRIP APP
ETCSUCH IS 
ATTAINABLE BY PURCHASING THE PRODUCT OR AVAILING THE SERVICES OF A CERTAIN BRAND
THESE 
ADVERTISEMENTS ARE MADE VERY CREATIVELY AND ATTRACT A LOT OF PEOPLE
SIMILARLYWHEN FOOD BRANDS SUCH AS DOMINO’S MCDONALD’S PIZZA HUT WHICH ARE ALREADY 
FAMOUS AND ADORED BY PEOPLE PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT IN NEWSPAPER TELEVISION ETC ABOUT 
THEIR NEW FOOD ITEM IT COMES IN TREND AND PEOPLE TEND TO TRY IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
APART FROM THIS THERE ARE CERTAIN ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH INSTILS VALUES IN CITIZENS SUCH AS 
ADVERTISEMENTS SHOWCASING PATRIOTIS
CERTAIN YOUTUBE ADVERTISEMENTS ALSO SHOW SMALL ACTS 
OF KINDNESS AND HOW THEY SPREAD HAPPINESS WOMEN EMPOWERMENT ETC
PAGE 4 BREAK
 
INFLUENCE  OF  ONLINE  WORLD  IN  POPULAR  CULTURE  AND  OUR 
CHOICES 
SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF NEW MEDIA EVERYTHING IS BEING DIGITALIZED AND PEOPLE THROUGH OUT THE 
WORLD HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND CAN COMMUNICATE IN AN EFFICIENT WAY
ELECTRONICS ARE 
MASS PRODUCED AND NEARLY EVERY PERSON WHETHER RICH OR POOR HAS SOME OR THE OTHER 
ELECTRONIC DEVICE
IT COULD BE A PHONE TABLET OR A LAPTOP
INTERNET OPENS PORTAL TO AN ONLINE 
WORLD WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE LIBERTY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
WITH THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IT HAS GIVEN POPULAR CULTURE A WHOLE NEW 
DEFINITION
EACH PERSON HAS THE LIBERTY TO POST WHATEVER THEY WANT
ANYBODY CAN OPEN UP 
THEIR YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND UPLOAD VIDEOS
IT HELPS PEOPLE TO SHOWCASE THEIR TALENT TO THE 
WORLD AND GET RECOGNISED
YOUTUBE IS A GREAT PLATFORM AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE REALLY BECOME FAMOUS THROUGH IT AND 
HAVE A GREAT FAN FOLLOWING
ONE SUCH PERSON IS BHUVAN BAM WHO HAS A CHANNEL NAMED “BB 
KI VINES” AND MAKES VIDEOS PLAYING DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
OTHERS ARE PRAJAKTA KOLI FROM 
“MOSTLY SANE” SUPERWOMAN THE LOVED TVF ACTOR “JITENDRA KUMAR” WHO IS CURRENTLY 
PLAYING THE ROLE OF JEETU IN “KOTA FACTORY” AND THE LIST IS ENDLESS
PEOPLE ALSO TEND TO TAKE 
UP THEIR FAVOURITE CHARACTERS HABITS SUCH AS DRESSING STYLE THEIR WAY OF COMMUNICATIONS 
THEIR FAMOUS LINES INTO THEIR DAILY LIFE ACTIVITIES
IT HAS ALSO GIVEN RECOGNITION TO SOME PROFESSIONS AND THESE PROFESSIONS HAVE NOW BECOME 
POPULAR
IT HAS ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO DO THESE PROFESSIONS FULL TIME RATHER THAN JUST BEING A 
HOBBY FOR EG
STANDUP COMEDIANS FASHION AND TRAVEL BLOGGER DANCER MUSICIANS ETC
STARTING FROM KENNY SEBASTIAN BISWA KANAN GILL ZAKIR KHAN TO NEWER ONES LIKE JASPREET 
SINGH MANIKMAHNA AND LIST IS ENDLESSALL OF THEM ARE SUCCESSFUL STANDUP COMEDIANS AND 
YOUTUBE WAS THE ONE THAT PROVIDED THEM SUCH A BIG AUDIENCE
PEOPLE LOVE STANDUP 
COMEDY TO AN EXTENT THAT IT EVEN GETS DIFFICULT TO GET SEATS IN A PARTICULAR STAND UP SHOW
WHEN KANAN GILL AND BISWA CAME TOGETHER WITH PRETENTIOUS MOVIE REVIEWS IT WAS ONE OF 
PAGE 5 BREAK
THE MOST TRENDING TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN EVERY PEER GROUP
THESE STANDUP COMEDIANS ALSO 
HAVE SHOWS ON “PRIME VIDEO” AND ARE NOW EVEN BEING STARRED IN FILMS DUE TO THEIR 
COMMENDABLE PERFORMANCE AND SENSE OF HUMOUR
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS GIVEN A PLATFORM TO MANY DANCER OR DANCE GROUPS TO SHOWCASE THEIR 
CHOREOGRAPHY FOR EG “TEAM NAACH” ROSE TO FAME SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE LOVED THEIR 
CHOREOGRAPHIES
THERE OUR OTHER CHANNELS AS WELL
PEOPLE WATCH THESE VIDEOS AND EVEN 
LEARN FROM THEM WHEN THERE IS SOME EVENT BE IT BIRTHDAYSANGEET OR WEDDING
SINCE THESE 
DANCERS TAKE UP LATEST SONGS PEOPLE ALSO GET TO KNOW ABOUT TRENDING SONGS
PEOPLE HAVE ALSO OPENED THEIR OWN DANCE ACADEMY  WHERE THEY RECORD AND UPLOAD VIDEOS
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS ALSO GIVEN A PATH FOR FOOD TRAVEL FASHION BLOGGERS ETC TO EXCEL
THEY 
UPLOAD VIDEOS WRITE BLOGS PUT SHORT VIDEOS ON INSTAGRAM ON THE PRODUCTS THEY USE PLACES 
THEY TRAVEL TO AND FOOD THEY TRY OUT AT DIFFERENT PLACES
ALL OF THIS COMES UNDER POPULAR CULTURE SINCE PEOPLE TEND TO CREATE LOOKS THAT ARE SHOWN 
BY FASHION BLOGGERS AND TEND TO BUY PRODUCTS USED BY THEM
PEOPLE TEND TO VISIT THE PLACES 
VISITED BY FOOD BLOGGERS TO TRY OUT THE DISH THEY TRIED
THIS HAS MADE PEOPLES LIFE EASIER 
SINCE NOW THEY DON’T  HAVE TO SPEND THEIR MIND THINKING ON WHAT TO BUY OR WHAT NOT TO 
BUY WHERE TO GO OUT FOR DINNER ETC FOR THEY CAN NOW DIRECTLY BUY THINGS OR GO TO PLACES 
THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY  THEIR BELOVED BLOGGERS
FOR EG VARIOUS FOOD BLOGGERS TEND TO 
PUT VIDEOS OF UNIQUE FOOD DISHES THAT DIFFERENT CAFES SERVE SUCH WOOD BOX CAFES PLATTER 
NITROGEN ICE CREAM
PAGE 6 BREAK
THIS DOESN’T END HERE VIDEOS TEND TO GO VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND BECOME POPULAR SUCH 
THAT EITHER IT BECOMES A TRENDING TOPIC OF DISCUSSION OR IF IT IS A CHALLENGER ACTIVITY THEN 
PEOPLE TEND TO DO IT EG
A CHALLENGES SUCH AS “ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE”  ”KIKICHALLENGE” ETC  
WERE DONE BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD TAGGING OTHER PEOPLE TO PERFORM IT AS 
WELL
INTERNET IS A SEA OF INFORMATION AND PROMOTES POPULAR CULTURE ON A LARGE SCALE 
 
THE CONTRIBUTION OF REALITY TV INTO POP CULTURE 
 
THE FIRST REALITY TV WAS BROADCASTED IN 1973
REALITY TV IS A TELEVISION PROGRAM IN WHICH THERE ARE NO WRITERS ACTORS
THE SHOWS FOCUS ON REAL SITUATIONS
REALITY TV HAS SLITHERED INTO OUR CULTURE
SOME REALITY PROGRAMMES ARE MASTERCHEF AUSTRALIA THE RISING STAR  INDIAN IDOL ETC
REALITY TV DEPENDS ON THE WILLINGNESS OF INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE THEIR LIVES PLAYED OUT IN FRONT 
OF A CAMERA
PAGE 7 BREAK
REALITY TV SHOWS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF POPULAR CULTURE TODAY AS REALITY TV SHOWS ALLOW 
ORDINARY  INDIVIDUALS  CHANCE  OF  GETTING  FAME  AND
CELEBRITIES IN FRONT OF THE WORLD
POPULAR CULTURE IS CONCERNED WITH ONLY ONE THING MONEY AND IT WILL DO EVERYTHING AND 
SACRIFICE ANYTHING TO ACHIEVE IT  INCLUDING HURTING THE SOCIETY IT IS MEANT TO SERVE
PUBG AND IT EFFECTS
PUBG BY TENCENT GAMES  IS ONE OF THE MOST PLAYED BATTLE GAME
I AND I AM SURE MANY  OF YOU MUST HAVE PLAYED THIS
IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT PUBG IS THEN 
PUBG HAS BOTH GOOD EFFECT AND 
PUBGIS CONSIDERED BY PARENTS AS TIME

POP CULTURE  AND  MEDIA  PIRACY 
 
EXPLOITATIVE MEDIA PIRACY SITES ARE THE SWAP SHOPS WHERE ONE CAN SHARE FILES IS JUST ONE 
OF THE MANY KINDS OF BOLLOCKS
AND I AM SURE MANY OF  US DID AND PROBABLY STILL WILLINGLY DO TAKE PART IN THIS FREE FOR ALL  
FILMS SOFTWARES GAMES AND EBOOKS
WE  HYPOCRITICALLY CLAIM US AS MUSIC LOVERS AND THEN WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT  WE ARE 
FREE DOWNLOADING MUSIC FROM ARTISTS
THESE ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SPEND A LOT OF THEIR 
EFFORTS ON ONE SINGLE SONG  THUS THEY NEED THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS ENFORCED UNDER COPYRIGHT TO 
SAVE THEIR  EFFORTS FROM VANISHING  AT JUST ONE GO
MEDIA PIRACY IS NOTHING MORE THAN STEALING  
IT MAY FEEL LIKE VICTIMLESS FREE CULTURE TO THE 
USER BUT THEY ARE IN FACT PARTICIPATING IN A DIGITAL BLACK MARKET
MAJOR EXPLOITATIVE BLACK 
MARKETERS ARE BLIND TECH COMPANIES WANTING TO GET RICH
THEY ARE CAPITALIZING ON THE 
LOOPHOLES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
IN THIS SENSE MEDIA PIRACY IS A SYMPTOM OF  UNDER 
DEVELOPMENT
THOSE WHO PIRATE MEDIA OFTEN WOULD NOT CONSIDER IT AS A THEFT OF ANY KIND  BECAUSE OF THEIR 
NEGLIGENCE OF THIS IMMORALITY ADULTS ARE  MORE LIKELY THAN CHILDREN TO PIRATE MOVIES SONGS 
AND GAMES BECAUSE ADULTS MAKE DECISIONS THAT SATISFY THEIR MORAL COMPASS AND CHILDREN 
TRY  NOT TO INDULGE IN SITUATIONS THAT WILL GET THEM INTO TROUBLE
PEOPLE MAY DECIDE THAT IT IS 
OKAY FOR THEM TO VIEW ILLEGAL CONTENT BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY IT AND THEY 
FEEL THAT THEY  DESERVE TO SEE IT
THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WHY PIRACY PERSISTS
SECONDLY 
EARLIER WE DIDN’T HAVE CONTENT PROVIDERS LIKE SPOTIFY OR NETFLIX RATHER VERY LESS AND  
PAGE 9 BREAK
 
 
INCONVENIENT SOURCES WERE AVAILABLE TO CONSUME MEDIA AND PIRACY FILLED IN THESE GAPS IN 
THE DEVELOPING WEB
FILMMAKERS PUT SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF EFFORT INTO THEIR PROJECTS BUT PIRATING FILMS 
UNDERMINES THEIR HARD WORK
THEIR DEDICATION AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL SHOULD BE A DRIVING 
FORCE THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TO THEATERS FOR VIEWING
POP CULTURE AND LATEST  TRENDS 
1
BEAUTY AND APPEARANCE 
             LIP INJECTIONS BUTT INJECTIONS CHEEK INJECTIONS BOTOX ARE SOME OF THE LATEST PREVAILING 
TRENDS THESE DAYS
THESE ARE NOT ONLY MAINSTREAM BUT ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED THESE DAYS
EARLIER TIMES SAW THE WORSHIP OF ACTRESSES THAT WERE UBER THIN BUT  CURRENT POP CULTURE 
TRENDS NOW FOCUS ON CURVY WOMEN
WE SEE WOMEN SPENDING A MAJOR PART OF THEIR 
INCOME IN MAINTAIN THEMSELVES WHILE GENERALLY FOR MEN ITS JUST ABOUT A HAIR CUT AND 
SHAVE

ME TOO 
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IS A MOVEMENT AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT  AND  SEXUAL ASSAULT
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING CELEBRITIES REPLIED WITH  METOO STORIES
IT GAINED A LOT OF 
ATTENTION FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD THE MOVEMENT EMPOWERED THE WOMEN TO FORM A 
COMMUNITY AND HELP EACH OTHER IN TALKING ABOUT THE BITTER TRUTHS OF SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE 
WORLD AND HAS  HELPED THE VICTIMS BETTER FIT IN THE SOCIETY
IT HAS  RAISED AWARENESS AMONG 
WOMEN ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AS AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE WORK PLACE OR OUTSIDE AND HAS ALSO HELPED 
MEN UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SAME

TIK TOK 
THESE DAYS SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR LIVES
THERE ARE SO MANY 
APPLICATIONS OUT THERE WHICH ARE MEANT FOR INFOTAINMENT AND ENTERTAINMENT
SOCIAL MEDIA 
IS A PLATFORM WHICH HELPS PEOPLE TO CONNECT
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE A LOT OF APPS 
WHICH ALSO HELP PEOPLE TO EARN NAME AND FAME
ONE SUCH APP IS TIKTOK
THE FIFTEEN 
SECOND VIDEO SHARING NETWORK IS  NOW A DAYS QUITE POPULAR IN THE COUNTRY
HOWEVER IT HAS 
COME UNDER THE SCANNER DUE TO ITS MISUSE BY THE YOUTH
IT’S BEEN A WHILE SINCE A NEW SOCIAL 
APPLICATION GOT HUGE FAME
TIKTOK HAS ABOUT 500 MILLION USERS AND IT’S GOING STRONGER BY 
THE MINUTE
IT A SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE FOR PEOPLE
PAGE 10 BREAK
 
 
CONCLUSION 
   MEDIA PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROMOTING SPREADING AD SHAPING POPULAR CULTURE
WHETHER IT IS TRADITIONAL MEDIA OR NEW MEDIA BOTH PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE AS A SOURCE OF 
POPULAR CULTURE
THE INFLUENCES OF CELEBRITIES AS A GOD HAVE BOTH ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS 
DISADVANTAGES REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE
WITH THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IT 
HAS GIVEN POPULAR CULTURE A WHOLE NEW DEFINITION
EACH PERSON HAS THE LIBERTY TO POST 
WHATEVER THEY WANT
ANYBODY CAN OPEN UP THEIR YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND UPLOAD VIDEOS
IT

SOCIETY SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE ONLINE AND FOLLOW
