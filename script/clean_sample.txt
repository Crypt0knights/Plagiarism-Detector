ABSTRACT
I ANATOMIZE A SUCCESSFUL OPENSOURCE PROJECT FETCHMAIL THAT
WAS RUN AS A DELIBERATE TEST OF SOME SURPRISING THEORIES ABOUT
SOWARE ENGINEERING SUGGESTED BY THE HISTORY OF LINUX
I DIS
CUSS THESE THEORIES IN TERMS OF TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIERENT
DEVELOPMENT STYLES THE “CATHEDRAL” MODEL OF MOST OF THE COM
MERCIAL WORLD VERSUS THE “BAZAAR” MODEL OF THE LINUX WORLD
I SHOW THAT THESE MODELS DERIVE FROM OPPOSING ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE SOWAREDEBUGGING TASK
I THEN MAKE A
SUSTAINED ARGUMENT FROM THE LINUX EXPERIENCE FOR THE PROPOSI
TION THAT “GIVEN ENOUGH EYEBALLS ALL BUGS ARE SHALLOW” SUGGEST
PRODUCTIVE ANALOGIES WITH OTHER SELFCORRECTING SYSTEMS OF SELF
ISH AGENTS AND CONCLUDE WITH SOME EXPLORATION OF THE IMPLICA
TIONS OF THIS INSIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF SOWARE
1  THE CATHEDRAL AND THE BAZAAR
LINUX IS SUBVERSIVE
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO
1991 THAT A WORLDCLASS OPERATING SYSTEM COULD COALESCE AS IF BY
MAGIC OUT OF PARTTIME HACKING BY SEVERAL THOUSAND DEVELOPERS SCAT
TERED ALL OVER THE PLANET CONNECTED ONLY BY THE TENUOUS STRANDS OF
THE INTERNET
CERTAINLY NOT I
BY THE TIME LINUX SWAM ONTO MY RADAR SCREEN
IN EARLY 1993 I HAD ALREADY BEEN INVOLVED IN UNIX AND OPENSOURCE
DEVELOPMENT FOR TEN YEARS
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRSTGNUCONTRIBUTORS
IN THE MID1980S
I HAD RELEASED A GOOD DEAL OF OPENSOURCE SO
WARE ONTO THE NET DEVELOPING OR CODEVELOPING SEVERAL PROGRAMS
NETHACK EMACS’SVCANDGUDMODES XLIFE AND OTHERS THAT ARE STILL
IN WIDE USE TODAY
I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW IT WAS DONE
LINUX OVERTURNED MUCH OF WHAT I THOUGHT I KNEW
I HAD BEEN

LUTIONARY PROGRAMMING FOR YEARS
BUT I ALSO BELIEVED THERE WAS A
CERTAIN CRITICAL COMPLEXITY ABOVE WHICH A MORE CENTRALIZED A PRIORI
APPROACH WAS REQUIRED
I BELIEVED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT SOWARE
OPERATING SYSTEMS AND REALLY LARGE TOOLS LIKE THE EMACS PROGRAM
MING EDITOR NEEDED TO BE BUILT LIKE CATHEDRALS CAREFULLY CRAED BY
INDIVIDUAL WIZARDS OR SMALL BANDS OF MAGES WORKING IN SPLENDID
ISOLATION WITH NO BETA TO BE RELEASED BEFORE ITS TIME
LINUS TORVALDS’S STYLE OF DEVELOPMENT – RELEASE EARLY AND OEN
DELEGATE EVERYTHING YOU CAN BE OPEN TO THE POINT OF PROMISCUITY
– CAME AS A SURPRISE
NO QUIET REVERENT CATHEDRALBUILDING HERE –
RATHER THE LINUX COMMUNITY SEEMED TO RESEMBLE A GREAT BABBLING
BAZAAR OF DIERING AGENDAS AND APPROACHES APTLY SYMBOLIZED BY
THE LINUX ARCHIVE SITES WHO’D TAKE SUBMISSIONS FROMANYONE OUT OF
WHICH A COHERENT AND STABLE SYSTEM COULD SEEMINGLY EMERGE ONLY BY
A SUCCESSION OF MIRACLES
THE FACT THAT THIS BAZAAR STYLE SEEMED TO WORK AND WORK WELL
CAME AS A DISTINCT SHOCK
AS I LEARNED MY WAY AROUND I WORKED
HARD NOT JUST AT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS BUT ALSO AT TRYING TO UNDER
STAND WHY THE LINUX WORLD NOT ONLY DIDN’T FLY APART IN CONFUSION
BUT SEEMED TO GO FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH AT A SPEED BARELY IMAG
INABLE TO CATHEDRALBUILDERS
BY MID1996 I THOUGHT I WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND
CHANCE
HANDED ME A PERFECT WAY TO TEST MY THEORY IN THE FORM OF AN OPEN
SOURCE PROJECT THAT I COULD CONSCIOUSLY TRY TO RUN IN THE BAZAAR STYLE
SO I DID – AND IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS
THIS IS THE STORY OF THAT PROJECT
I’LL USE IT TO PROPOSE SOME APHO
RISMS ABOUT EECTIVE OPENSOURCE DEVELOPMENT
NOT ALL OF THESE ARE
THINGS I FIRST LEARNED IN THE LINUX WORLD BUT WE’LL SEE HOW THE LINUX

FOUNTAIN OF GOOD SOWARE – AND PERHAPS THEY WILL HELP YOU BECOME

THIS WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING THE COMPUTER OUGHT TO BE DOING FOR

BUT NONE OF THE EXISTINGPOPCLIENTS KNEW HOW

US TO THE FIRST LESSON
 1EVERY GOOD WORK OF SOWARE STARTS BY SCRATCHING A DEVELOPER’S
PERSONAL ITCH
PERHAPS THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS IT’S LONG BEEN PROVERBIAL
THAT “NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION” BUT TOO OEN SOWARE
DEVELOPERS SPEND THEIR DAYS GRINDING AWAY FOR PAY AT PROGRAMS THEY
NEITHER NEED NOR LOVE

SO DID I IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH INTO A FURIOUS WHIRL OF CODING UP
A BRANDNEWPOP3CLIENT TO COMPETE WITH THE EXISTING ONES
NOT ON
YOUR LIFE
I LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THEPOPUTILITIES I HAD IN HAND ASKING
MYSELF “WHICH ONE IS CLOSEST TO WHAT I WANT” BECAUSE
 2GOOD PROGRAMMERS KNOW WHAT TO WRITE
GREAT ONES KNOW WHAT
TO REWRITE AND REUSE
WHILE I DON’T CLAIM TO BE A GREAT PROGRAMMER I TRY TO IMITATE ONE
AN IMPORTANT TRAIT OF THE GREAT ONES IS CONSTRUCTIVE LAZINESS
THEY
KNOW THAT YOU GET AN A NOT FOR EORT BUT FOR RESULTS AND THAT IT’S
ALMOST ALWAYS EASIER TO START FROM A GOOD PARTIAL SOLUTION THAN FROM
NOTHING AT ALL
LINUS TORVALDS FOR EXAMPLE DIDN’T ACTUALLY TRY TO WRITE LINUX
FROM SCRATCH
INSTEAD HE STARTED BY REUSING CODE AND IDEAS FROM
MINIX A TINY UNIXLIKE OPERATING SYSTEM FORPCCLONES
EVENTUALLY
ALL THE MINIX CODE WENT AWAY OR WAS COMPLETELY REWRITTEN – BUT
WHILE IT WAS THERE IT PROVIDED SCAOLDING FOR THE INFANT THAT WOULD
EVENTUALLY BECOME LINUX
IN THE SAME SPIRIT I WENT LOOKING FOR AN EXISTINGPOPUTILITY THAT
WAS REASONABLY WELL CODED TO USE AS A DEVELOPMENT BASE
THE SOURCESHARING TRADITION OF THE UNIX WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN
FRIENDLY TO CODE REUSE THIS IS WHY THEGNUPROJECT CHOSE UNIX AS

OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY YOU OEN DON’T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEM UNTIL AER THE FIRST TIME YOU IMPLEMENT A SOLUTION
THE
SECOND TIME MAYBE YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO DO IT RIGHT
SO IF YOU WANT
TO GET IT RIGHT BE READY TO START OVER AT LEAST ONCEJB
WELL I TOLD MYSELF THE CHANGES TO FETCHPOP HAD BEEN MY FIRST TRY
SO I SWITCHED
AER I SENT MY FIRST SET OF POPCLIENT PATCHES TO CARL HARRIS ON 25
JUNE 1996 I FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD BASICALLY LOST INTEREST IN POPCLIENT
SOMETIMEBEFORETHECODEWASABITDUSTYWITHMINORBUGSHANGING
OUT
I HAD MANY CHANGES TO MAKE AND WE QUICKLY AGREED THAT THE
LOGICAL THING FOR ME TO DO WAS TAKE OVER THE PROGRAM
WITHOUTMYACTUALLYNOTICINGTHEPROJECTHADESCALATEDNOLONGER
WAS I JUST CONTEMPLATING MINOR PATCHES TO AN EXISTINGPOPCLIENT
I
TOOK ON MAINTAINING AN ENTIRE ONE AND THERE WERE IDEAS BUBBLING
IN MY HEAD THAT I KNEW WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO MAJOR CHANGES
IN A SOWARE CULTURE THAT ENCOURAGES CODESHARING THIS IS A NAT
URAL WAY FOR A PROJECT TO EVOLVE
I WAS ACTING OUT THIS PRINCIPLE

BUT CARL HARRIS’S ATTITUDE WAS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
HE UNDER
STOOD THAT
PAGE 4 BREAK
63  THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING USERS
 5WHEN YOU LOSE INTEREST IN A PROGRAM YOUR LAST DUTY TO IT IS TO
HAND IT OTO A COMPETENT SUCCESSOR
WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO DISCUSS IT CARL AND I KNEW WE HAD A COM
MON GOAL OF HAVING THE BEST SOLUTION OUT THERE
THE ONLY QUESTION
FOR EITHER OF US WAS WHETHER I COULD ESTABLISH THAT I WAS A SAFE PAIR
OF HANDS
ONCE I DID THAT HE ACTED WITH GRACE AND DISPATCH
I HOPE I
WILL DO AS WELL WHEN IT COMES MY TURN
3  THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING USERS
AND SO I INHERITED POPCLIENT
JUST AS IMPORTANTLY I INHERITED POP
CLIENT’S USER BASE
USERS ARE WONDERFUL THINGS TO HAVE AND NOT JUST
BECAUSE THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU’RE SERVING A NEED THAT YOU’VE
DONE SOMETHING RIGHT
PROPERLY CULTIVATED THEY CAN BECOME CODE
VELOPERS
ANOTHER STRENGTH OF THE UNIX TRADITION ONE THAT LINUX PUSHES
TO A HAPPY EXTREME IS THAT A LOT OF USERS ARE HACKERS TOO
BECAUSE
SOURCE CODE IS AVAILABLE THEY CAN BEEECTIVEHACKERS
THIS CAN BE
TREMENDOUSLY USEFUL FOR SHORTENING DEBUGGING TIME

 6TREATING YOUR USERS AS CODEVELOPERS IS YOUR LEASTHASSLE ROUTE TO
RAPID CODE IMPROVEMENT AND EECTIVE DEBUGGING
THE POWER OF THIS EECT IS EASY TO UNDERESTIMATE
IN FACT PRETTY
WELL ALL OF US IN THE OPENSOURCE WORLD DRASTICALLY UNDERESTIMATED
HOW WELL IT WOULD SCALE UP WITH NUMBER OF USERS AND AGAINST SYSTEM
COMPLEXITY UNTIL LINUS TORVALDS SHOWED US DIERENTLY
IN FACT I THINK LINUS’S CLEVEREST AND MOST CONSEQUENTIAL HACK
WAS NOT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LINUX KERNEL ITSELF BUT RATHER HIS
INVENTION OF THE LINUX DEVELOPMENT MODEL
WHEN I EXPRESSED THIS
OPINION IN HIS PRESENCE ONCE HE SMILED AND QUIETLY REPEATED SOME
THING HE HAS OEN SAID “I’M BASICALLY A VERY LAZY PERSON WHO LIKES
TO GET CREDIT FOR THINGS OTHER PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO” LAZY LIKE A FOX
OR
AS ROBERT HEINLEIN FAMOUSLY WROTE OF ONE OF HIS CHARACTERS TOO LAZY

4  RELEASE EARLY RELEASE OEN
EARLY AND FREQUENT RELEASES ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE LINUX DEVELOP
MENT MODEL
MOST DEVELOPERS INCLUDING ME USED TO BELIEVE THIS
WAS BAD POLICY FOR LARGER THAN TRIVIAL PROJECTS BECAUSE EARLY VERSIONS
ARE ALMOST BY DEFINITION BUGGY VERSIONS AND YOU DON’T WANT TO WEAR
OUT THE PATIENCE OF YOUR USERS
THIS BELIEF REINFORCED THE GENERAL COMMITMENT TO A CATHEDRAL
BUILDING STYLE OF DEVELOPMENT
IF THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE WAS FOR
USERS TO SEE AS FEW BUGS AS POSSIBLE WHY THEN YOU’D ONLY RELEASE A
VERSION EVERY SIX MONTHS OR LESS OEN AND WORK LIKE A DOG ON DE
BUGGINGBETWEENRELEASESTHEEMACSCCOREWASDEVELOPEDTHISWAY
THE LISP LIBRARY IN EECT WAS NOT – BECAUSE THERE WERE ACTIVE LISP
ARCHIVES OUTSIDE THEFSF’S CONTROL WHERE YOU COULD GO TO FIND NEW

THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE THE OHIO STATE ELISP ARCHIVE AN

BEEN UNIXWORLD TRADITION FOR A LONG TIME BUT IN SCALING IT UP TO
A LEVEL OF INTENSITY THAT MATCHED THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT HE WAS
DEVELOPING
IN THOSE EARLY TIMES AROUND 1991 IT WASN’T UNKNOWN
FOR HIM TO RELEASE A NEW KERNEL MORE THAN ONCE A DAY
BECAUSE HE
CULTIVATED HIS BASE OF CODEVELOPERS AND LEVERAGED THE INTERNET FOR
COLLABORATION HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE THIS WORKED
BUTHOWDID IT WORK
AND WAS IT SOMETHING I COULD DUPLICATE OR
DID IT RELY ON SOME UNIQUE GENIUS OF LINUS TORVALDS
I DIDN’T THINK SO
GRANTED LINUS IS A DAMN FINE HACKER
HOW
MANY OF US COULD ENGINEER AN ENTIRE PRODUCTIONQUALITY OPERATING
SYSTEM KERNEL FROM SCRATCH
BUT LINUX DIDN’T REPRESENT ANY AWE
SOME CONCEPTUAL LEAP FORWARD
LINUS IS NOT OR AT LEAST NOT YET AN
INNOVATIVE GENIUS OF DESIGN IN THE WAY THAT SAY RICHARDSTALLMAN OR
JAMES GOSLING OF NEWS AND JAVA ARE
RATHER LINUS SEEMS TO ME TO
BE A GENIUS OF ENGINEERING AND IMPLEMENTATION WITH A SIXTH SENSE
FOR AVOIDING BUGS AND DEVELOPMENT DEADENDS AND A TRUE KNACK FOR
FINDING THE MINIMUMEORT PATH FROM POINT A TO POINT B
INDEED
THE WHOLE DESIGN OF LINUX BREATHES THIS QUALITY AND MIRRORS LINUS’S
ESSENTIALLY CONSERVATIVE AND SIMPLIFYING DESIGN APPROACH
SO IF RAPID RELEASES AND LEVERAGING THE INTERNET MEDIUM TO THE
HILT WERE NOT ACCIDENTS BUT INTEGRAL PARTS OF LINUS’S ENGINEERING
GENIUS INSIGHT INTO THE MINIMUMEORT PATH WHAT WAS HE MAXIMIZ
ING
WHAT WAS HE CRANKING OUT OF THE MACHINERY
PUT THAT WAY THE QUESTION ANSWERS ITSELF

THEPROSPECTOFHAVINGANEGOSATISFYINGPIECEOFTHEACTIONREWARDED
BY THE SIGHT OF CONSTANT EVENDAILY IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR WORK
LINUS WAS DIRECTLY AIMING TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF PERSON
HOURS THROWN AT DEBUGGING AND DEVELOPMENT EVEN AT THE POSSIBLE
COST OF INSTABILITY IN THE CODE AND USERBASE BURNOUT IF ANY SERIOUS
BUG PROVED INTRACTABLE
LINUS WAS BEHAVING AS THOUGH HE BELIEVED
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
 8GIVEN A LARGE ENOUGH BETATESTER AND CODEVELOPER BASE ALMOST
EVERY PROBLEM WILL BE CHARACTERIZED QUICKLY AND THE FIX OBVIOUS TO
SOMEONE
OR LESS FORMALLY “GIVEN ENOUGH EYEBALLS ALL BUGS ARE SHALLOW” I
DUB THIS “LINUS’S LAW”
MY ORIGINAL FORMULATION WAS THAT EVERY PROBLEM “WILL BE TRANS
PARENT TO SOMEBODY”
LINUS DEMURRED THAT THE PERSON WHO UNDER
STANDS AND FIXES THE PROBLEM IS NOT NECESSARILY OR EVEN USUALLY THE
PERSON WHO FIRST CHARACTERIZES IT
“SOMEBODY FINDS THE PROBLEM” HE
SAYS “AND SOMEBODYELSEUNDERSTANDS IT
AND I’LL GO ON RECORD AS
SAYING THAT FINDING IT IS THE BIGGER CHALLENGE” BUT THE POINT IS THAT
BOTH THINGS TEND TO HAPPEN RAPIDLY
HERE I THINK IS THE CORE DIERENCE UNDERLYING THE CATHEDRAL
BUILDER AND BAZAAR STYLES
IN THE CATHEDRALBUILDER VIEW OF PROGRAM
MING BUGS AND DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS ARE TRICKY INSIDIOUS DEEP
PHENOMENA
IT TAKES MONTHS OF SCRUTINY BY A DEDICATED FEW TO DE
VELOP CONFIDENCE THAT YOU’VE WINKLED THEM ALL OUT
THUS THE LONG
RELEASE INTERVALS AND THE INEVITABLE DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN LONG
AWAITED RELEASES ARE NOT PERFECT
IN THE BAZAAR VIEW ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ASSUME THAT BUGS
ARE GENERALLY SHALLOW PHENOMENA – OR AT LEAST THAT THEY TURN SHAL
LOW PRETTY QUICKLY WHEN EXPOSED TO A THOUSAND EAGER CODEVELOPERS

IN ORDER TO GET MORE CORRECTIONS AND AS A BENEFICIAL SIDE EECT YOU

IT APPEARS THAT WHAT LINUS HAS

PRODUCE AN APPARENTLY REASONABLE FIX
ANYONE WHO PASSES ALL THESE
FILTERS IS HIGHLY LIKELY TO HAVE SOMETHING USEFUL TO CONTRIBUTE
I AM INDEBTED TO MY FRIEND JEDUTKYDUTKYWAMUMDEDU
FOR POINTING OUT THAT LINUS’S LAW CAN BE REPHRASED AS “DEBUGGING
IS PARALLELIZABLE”
JEOBSERVES THAT ALTHOUGH DEBUGGING REQUIRES
DEBUGGERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOME COORDINATING DEVELOPER IT
DOESN’T REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT COORDINATION BETWEEN DEBUGGERS
THUS IT
DOESN’T FALL PREY TO THE SAME QUADRATIC COMPLEXITY AND MANAGEMENT
COSTS THAT MAKE ADDING DEVELOPERS PROBLEMATIC
IN PRACTICE THE THEORETICAL LOSS OF ECIENCY DUE TO DUPLICATION OF
WORK BY DEBUGGERS ALMOST NEVER SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE IN THE LINUX
WORLD
ONE EECT OF A “RELEASE EARLY AND OEN POLICY” IS TO MINIMIZE
SUCH DUPLICATION BY PROPAGATING FEDBACK FIXES QUICKLYJH
BROOKS THE AUTHOR OF “THE MYTHICAL MANMONTH” EVEN MADE AN
OHAND OBSERVATION RELATED TO JE’S “THE TOTAL COST OF MAINTAINING
A WIDELY USED PROGRAM IS TYPICALLY 40 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE COST
OF DEVELOPING IT

SO ADDING MORE BETATESTERS MAY NOT REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF
THE CURRENT “DEEPEST” BUG FROM THEDEVELOPER’SPOINT OF VIEW BUT IT
INCREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT SOMEONE’S TOOLKIT WILL BE MATCHED TO
THE PROBLEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE BUG IS SHALLOWTO THAT PERSON
LINUS COPPERS HIS BETS TOO
IN CASE THERE ARE SERIOUS BUGS LINUX
KERNEL VERSION ARE NUMBERED IN SUCH A WAY THAT POTENTIAL USERS CAN
MAKE A CHOICE EITHER TO RUN THE LAST VERSION DESIGNATED “STABLE” OR
TO RIDE THE CUTTING EDGE AND RISK BUGS IN ORDER TO GET NEW FEATURES
THIS TACTIC IS NOT YET FORMALLY IMITATED BY MOST LINUX HACKERS BUT
PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE THE FACT THAT EITHER CHOICE IS AVAILABLE MAKES
BOTH MORE ATTRACTIVE

5  WHEN IS A ROSE NOT A ROSE 
HAVING STUDIED LINUS’S BEHAVIOR AND FORMED A THEORY ABOUT WHY IT
WAS SUCCESSFUL I MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO TEST THIS THEORY ON MY
NEW ADMITTEDLY MUCH LESS COMPLEX AND AMBITIOUS PROJECT
BUT THE FIRST THING I DID WAS REORGANIZE AND SIMPLIFY POPCLIENT
A LOT
CARL HARRIS’S IMPLEMENTATION WAS VERY SOUND BUT EXHIBITED A
KIND OF UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY COMMON TO MANY C PROGRAMMERS
HE TREATED THE CODE AS CENTRAL AND THE DATA STRUCTURES AS SUPPORT FOR
THE CODE
AS A RESULT THE CODE WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT THE DATA STRUCTURE
DESIGN ADHOC AND RATHER UGLY AT LEAST BY THE HIGH STANDARDS OF THIS
OLDLISPHACKER
I HAD ANOTHER PURPOSE FOR REWRITING BESIDES IMPROVING THE CODE
AND THE DATA STRUCTURE DESIGN HOWEVER
THAT WAS TO EVOLVE IT INTO
SOMETHING I UNDERSTOOD COMPLETELY
IT’S NO FUN TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
FIXING BUGS IN A PROGRAM YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND
FOR THE FIRST MONTH OR SO THEN I WAS SIMPLY FOLLOWING OUT THE
IMPLICATIONS OF CARL’S BASIC DESIGN
THE FIRST SERIOUS CHANGE I MADE
WAS TO ADDIMAPSUPPORT
I DID THIS BY REORGANIZING THE PROTOCOL
MACHINES INTO A GENERIC DRIVER AND THREE METHOD TABLES FORPOP2
POP3 ANDIMAP
THIS AND THE PREVIOUS CHANGES ILLUSTRATE A GENERAL
PRINCIPLE THAT’S GOOD FOR PROGRAMMERS TO KEEP IN MIND ESPECIALLY
IN LANGUAGES LIKE C THAT DON’T NATURALLY DO DYNAMIC TYPING

OTHER WAY AROUND

YEARS OF TERMINOLOGICALCULTURAL SHI IT’S ALMOST THE SAME POINT
AT THIS POINT EARLY SEPTEMBER 1996 ABOUT SIX WEEKS FROM ZERO I
STARTED THINKING THAT A NAME CHANGE MIGHT BE IN ORDER – AER ALL IT
WASN’T JUST APOPCLIENT ANY MORE
BUT I HESITATED BECAUSE THERE WAS
AS YET NOTHING GENUINELY NEW IN THE DESIGN
MY VERSION OF POPCLIENT
HAD YET TO DEVELOP AN IDENTITY OF ITS OWN
THAT CHANGED RADICALLY WHEN FETCHMAIL LEARNED HOW TO FORWARD
FETCHED MAIL TO THESMTPPORT
I’LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT
BUT FIRST I
SAID ABOVE THAT I’D DECIDED TO USE THIS PROJECT TO TEST MY THEORY ABOUT
WHAT LINUS TORVALDS HAD DONE RIGHT
HOW YOU MAY WELL ASK DID I
DO THAT
IN THESE WAYS
– I RELEASED EARLY AND OEN ALMOST NEVER LESS OEN THAN EVERY
TEN DAYS DURING PERIODS OF INTENSE DEVELOPMENT ONCE A DAY
– I GREW MY BETA LIST BY ADDING TO IT EVERYONE WHO CONTACTED ME
ABOUT FETCHMAIL
– I SENT CHATTY ANNOUNCEMENTS TO THE BETA LIST WHENEVER I RE
LEASED ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE
– AND I LISTENED TO MY BETA TESTERS POLLING THEM ABOUT DESIGN
DECISIONS AND STROKING THEM WHENEVER THEY SENT IN PATCHES
AND FEEDBACK
THEPAYOFROMTHESESIMPLEMEASURESWASIMMEDIATEFROMTHE
BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT I GOT BUG REPORTS OF A QUALITY MOST DEVEL

ONE INTERESTING MEASURE OF FETCHMAIL’S SUCCESS IS THE SHEER SIZE
OF THE PROJECT BETA LIST FETCHMAILFRIENDS
AT THE TIME OF LAST REVISION
AUGUST 2000 IT HAS 249 MEMBERS AND IS ADDING TWO OR THREE A WEEK
ACTUALLY AS I REVISE IN LATE MAY 1997 THE LIST IS BEGINNING TO LOSE
MEMBERS FROM ITS HIGH OF CLOSE TO 300 FOR AN INTERESTING REASON
PAGE 11 BREAK

SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME TO UNSUBSCRIBE THEM BECAUSE FETCH
MAIL IS WORKING SO WELL FOR THEM THAT THEY NO LONGER NEED TO SEE THE
LIST TRAC
PERHAPS THIS IS PART OF THE NORMAL LIFECYCLE OF A MATURE
BAZAARSTYLE PROJECT
6  POPCLIENT BECOMES FETCHMAIL
THE REAL TURNING POINT IN THE PROJECT WAS WHEN HARRY HOCHHEISER
SENT ME HIS SCRATCH CODE FOR FORWARDING MAIL TO THE CLIENT MACHINE’S
SMTPPORT
I REALIZED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THAT A RELIABLE IMPLEMEN
TATION OF THIS FEATURE WOULD MAKE ALL THE OTHER MAIL DELIVERY MODES
NEXT TO OBSOLETE
FOR MANY WEEKS I HAD BEEN TWEAKING FETCHMAIL RATHER INCRE
MENTALLY WHILE FEELING LIKE THE INTERFACE DESIGN WAS SERVICEABLE BUT
GRUBBY – INELEGANT AND WITH TOO MANY EXIGUOUS OPTIONS HANGING
OUT ALL OVER
THE OPTIONS TO DUMP FETCHED MAIL TO A MAILBOX FILE OR
STANDARD OUTPUT PARTICULARLY BOTHERED ME BUT I COULDN’T FIGURE OUT
WHY
IF YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT THE TECHNICALIA OF INTERNET MAIL THE NEXT
TWO PARAGRAPHS CAN BE SAFELY SKIPPED

IDEAS FROM YOUR USERS
SOMETIMES THE LATTER IS BETTER
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH YOU WILL QUICKLY FIND THAT IF YOU ARE COM
PLETELY AND SELF DEPRECATINGLY TRUTHFUL ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU OWE
OTHER PEOPLE THE WORLD AT LARGE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE YOU DID EVERY
BIT OF THE INVENTION YOURSELF AND ARE JUST BEING BECOMINGLY MODEST

THE WHOLE AUDIENCE LAUGHED BECAUSE THEY KNEW THIS HAD WORKED
FOR THE INVENTOR OF PERL TOO
AER A VERY FEW WEEKS OF RUNNING THE PROJECT IN THE SAME SPIRIT
I BEGAN TO GET SIMILAR PRAISE NOT JUST FROM MY USERS BUT FROM OTHER
PEOPLE TO WHOM THE WORD LEAKED OUT
I STASHED AWAY SOME OF THAT
EMAILI’LLLOOKATITAGAINSOMETIMEIFIEVERSTARTWONDERINGWHETHER
MY LIFE HAS BEEN WORTHWHILE –
BUT THERE ARE TWO MORE FUNDAMENTAL NONPOLITICAL LESSONS HERE
THAT ARE GENERAL TO ALL KINDS OF DESIGN
 12OEN THE MOST STRIKING AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS COME FROM
REALIZING THAT YOUR CONCEPT OF THE PROBLEM WAS WRONG
I HAD BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE THE WRONG PROBLEM BY CONTINUING TO
DEVELOP POPCLIENT AS A COMBINEDMTAMDAWITH ALL KINDS OF FUNKY
LOCAL DELIVERY MODES
FETCHMAIL’S DESIGN NEEDED TO BE RETHOUGHT
FROMTHEGROUNDUPASAPUREMTAAPARTOFTHENORMALSMTPSPEAKING
INTERNET MAIL PATH
WHEN YOU HIT A WALL IN DEVELOPMENT – WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF
HARD PUT TO THINK PAST THE NEXT PATCH – IT’S OEN TIME TO ASK NOT
WHETHER YOU’VE GOT THE RIGHT ANSWER BUT WHETHER YOU’RE ASKING THE
RIGHT QUESTION
PERHAPS THE PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE REFRAMED
WELL I HAD REFRAMED MY PROBLEM
CLEARLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO
WAS 1 HACKSMTPFORWARDING SUPPORT INTO THE GENERIC DRIVER 2
MAKE IT THE DEFAULT MODE AND 3 EVENTUALLY THROW OUT ALL THE OTHER
DELIVERY MODES ESPECIALLY THE DELIVERTOFILE AND DELIVERTOSTANDARD
OUTPUT OPTIONS
I HESITATED OVER STEP 3 FOR SOME TIME FEARING TO UPSET LONGTIME
POPCLIENT USERS DEPENDENT ON THE ALTERNATE DELIVERY MECHANISMS
PAGE 13 BREAK

IN THEORY THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY SWITCH TOFORWARDFILES OR THEIR
NONSENDMAIL EQUIVALENTS TO GET THE SAME EECTS
IN PRACTICE THE
TRANSITION MIGHT HAVE BEEN MESSY
BUT WHEN I DID IT THE BENEFITS PROVED HUGE
THE CRUIEST PARTS OF
THE DRIVER CODE VANISHED
CONFIGURATION GOT RADICALLY SIMPLER – NO
MORE GROVELLING AROUND FOR THE SYSTEMMDAAND USER’S MAILBOX NO
MOREWORRIESABOUTWHETHERTHEUNDERLYINGOSSUPPORTSFILELOCKING
ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO LOSE MAIL VANISHED
IF YOU SPECIFIED DELIVERY
TO A FILE AND THE DISK GOT FULL YOUR MAIL GOT LOST
THIS CAN’T HAPPEN
WITHSMTPFORWARDING BECAUSE YOURSMTPLISTENER WON’T RETURNOK
UNLESS THE MESSAGE CAN BE DELIVERED OR AT LEAST SPOOLED FOR LATER
DELIVERY
ALSO PERFORMANCE IMPROVED THOUGH NOT SO YOU’D NOTICE IT IN A
SINGLERUN
ANOTHER NOT INSIGNIFICANT BENEFIT OF THIS CHANGE WAS THAT
THE MANUAL PAGE GOT A LOT SIMPLER
LATER I HAD TO BRING DELIVERY VIA A USERSPECIFIED LOCALMDABACK
IN ORDER TO ALLOW HANDLING OF SOME OBSCURE SITUATIONS INVOLVING DY
NAMICSLIP
BUT I FOUND A MUCH SIMPLER WAY TO DO IT
THE MORAL
DON’T HESITATE TO THROW AWAY SUPERANNUATED FEATURES
WHEN YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF EECTIVENESS
ANTOINE DE SAINT
EXUPÉRY WHO WAS AN AVIATOR AND AIRCRADESIGNER WHEN HE WASN’T
BEING THE AUTHOR OF CLASSIC CHILDREN’S BOOKS SAID
 13“PERFECTION IN DESIGN IS ACHIEVED NOT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING
MORE TO ADD BUT RATHER WHEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO TAKE AWAY”
WHEN YOUR CODE IS GETTING BOTH BETTER AND SIMPLER THAT IS WHEN
YOUKNOWIT’SRIGHTANDINTHEPROCESSTHEFETCHMAILDESIGNACQUIRED
AN IDENTITY OF ITS OWN DIERENT FROM THE ANCESTRAL POPCLIENT
IT WAS TIME FOR THE NAME CHANGE
THE NEW DESIGN LOOKED MUCH
MORE LIKE A DUAL OF SENDMAIL THAN THE OLD POPCLIENT HAD BOTH ARE

PULLS THENDELIVERS

THERE IS A MORE GENERAL LESSON IN THIS STORY ABOUT HOWSMTPDELIV
ERY CAME TO FETCHMAIL
IT IS NOT ONLY DEBUGGING THAT IS PARALLELIZABLE
DEVELOPMENT AND TO A PERHAPS SURPRISING EXTENT EXPLORATION OF DE

EVEN AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF DESIGN IT CAN BE VERY VALUABLE TO HAVE

TIALLY BY DIUSION FOLLOWED BY EXPLOITATION MEDIATED BY A SCALABLE

HOCHHEISER AND ME ONE OF YOUR OUTRIDERS MAY WELL FIND A HUGE WIN
NEARBY THAT YOU WERE JUST A LITTLE TOO CLOSEFOCUSED TO SEE
7  FETCHMAIL GROWS UP
THERE I WAS WITH A NEAT AND INNOVATIVE DESIGN CODE THAT I KNEW
WORKED WELL BECAUSE I USED IT EVERY DAY AND A BURGEONING BETA LIST
IT GRADUALLY DAWNED ON ME THAT I WAS NO LONGER ENGAGED IN A TRIVIAL
PERSONAL HACK THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE USEFUL TO FEW OTHER PEOPLE
I HAD MY HANDS ON A PROGRAM EVERY HACKER WITH A UNIX BOX AND A
SLIPPPPMAIL CONNECTION REALLY NEEDS
WITH THESMTPFORWARDING FEATURE IT PULLED FAR ENOUGH IN FRONT
OF THE COMPETITION TO POTENTIALLY BECOME A “CATEGORY KILLER” ONE OF
THOSE CLASSIC PROGRAMS THAT FILLS ITS NICHE SO COMPETENTLY THAT THE
ALTERNATIVES ARE NOT JUST DISCARDED BUT ALMOST FORGOTTEN
I THINK YOU CAN’T REALLY AIM OR PLAN FOR A RESULT LIKE THIS
YOU HAVE
TO GET PULLED INTO IT BY DESIGN IDEAS SO POWERFUL THAT AERWARD THE
RESULTS JUST SEEM INEVITABLE NATURAL EVEN FOREORDAINED
THE ONLY
WAY TO TRY FOR IDEAS LIKE THAT IS BY HAVING LOTS OF IDEAS – OR BY HAVING
THE ENGINEERING JUDGMENT TO TAKE OTHER PEOPLES’ GOOD IDEAS BEYOND
WHERE THE ORIGINATORS THOUGHT THEY COULD GO
ANDY TANENBAUM HAD THE ORIGINAL IDEA TO BUILD A SIMPLE NATIVE
UNIX FORIBM PCS FOR USE AS A TEACHING TOOL HE CALLED IT MINIX
LINUS
TORVALDS PUSHED THE MINIX CONCEPT FURTHER THAN ANDREW PROBABLY
THOUGHT IT COULD GO – AND IT GREW INTO SOMETHING WONDERFUL
IN THE
SAME WAY THOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE I TOOK SOME IDEAS BY CARL
HARRIS AND HARRY HOCHHEISER AND PUSHED THEM HARD
NEITHER OF US
WAS ‘ORIGINAL’ IN THE ROMANTIC WAY PEOPLE THINK IS GENIUS
BUT THEN
MOST SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND SOWARE DEVELOPMENT ISN’T DONE
BY ORIGINAL GENIUS HACKER MYTHOLOGY TO THE CONTRARY
THE RESULTS WERE PRETTY HEADY STUALL THE SAME – IN FACT JUST
THE KIND OF SUCCESS EVERY HACKER LIVES FOR

AND DO THAT WHILE KEEPING THE PROGRAM SIMPLE AND ROBUST
THE FIRST AND OVERWHELMINGLY MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE I WROTE
AER REALIZING THIS WAS MULTIDROP SUPPORT – THE ABILITY TO FETCH MAIL
FROM MAILBOXES THAT HAD ACCUMULATED ALL MAIL FOR A GROUP OF USERS
AND THEN ROUTE EACH PIECE OF MAIL TO ITS INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS

PIECE OF IT IS HARD BUT BECAUSE IT INVOLVED A PILE OF INTERDEPENDENT

DECISION AS WELL
HERE’S HOW I KNEW
 14ANY TOOL SHOULD BE USEFUL IN THE EXPECTED WAY BUT A TRULY GREAT
TOOL LENDS ITSELF TO USES YOU NEVER EXPECTED
THE UNEXPECTED USE FOR MULTIDROP FETCHMAIL IS TO RUN MAILING
LISTS WITH THE LIST KEPT AND ALIAS EXPANSION DONE ON THECLIENTSIDE OF
THE INTERNET CONNECTION

MORE LIKE ENGLISH MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER TO USE
NOW ALTHOUGH I’M A
CONVINCED PARTISAN OF THE “MAKE IT A LANGUAGE” SCHOOL OF DESIGN AS
EXEMPLIFIED BY EMACS ANDHTMLAND MANY DATABASE ENGINES I AM
NOT NORMALLY A BIG FAN OF “ENGLISHLIKE” SYNTAXES
TRADITIONALLYPROGRAMMERSHAVETENDEDTOFAVORCONTROLSYNTAXES
THAT ARE VERY PRECISE AND COMPACT AND HAVE NO REDUNDANCY AT ALL
THIS IS A CULTURAL LEGACY FROM WHEN COMPUTING RESOURCES WERE EX
PENSIVE SO PARSING STAGES HAD TO BE AS CHEAP AND SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
ENGLISH WITH ABOUT 50 REDUNDANCY LOOKED LIKE A VERY INAPPROPRI
ATE MODEL THEN
THIS IS NOT MY REASON FOR NORMALLY AVOIDING ENGLISHLIKE SYN
TAXES I MENTION IT HERE ONLY TO DEMOLISH IT
WITH CHEAP CYCLES AND
CORE TERSENESS SHOULD NOT BE AN END IN ITSELF
NOWADAYS IT’S MORE
IMPORTANT FOR A LANGUAGE TO BE CONVENIENT FOR HUMANS THAN TO BE
CHEAP FOR THE COMPUTER
THERE REMAIN HOWEVER GOOD REASONS TO BE WARY
ONE IS THE COM
PLEXITY COST OF THE PARSING STAGE – YOU DON’T WANT TO RAISE THAT TO
THE POINT WHERE IT’S A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF BUGS AND USER CONFUSION
IN ITSELF
ANOTHER IS THAT TRYING TO MAKE A LANGUAGE SYNTAX ENGLISH
LIKE OEN DEMANDS THAT THE “ENGLISH” IT SPEAKS BE BENT SERIOUSLY
OUT OF SHAPE SO MUCH SO THAT THE SUPERFICIAL RESEMBLANCE TO NATURAL
PAGE 17 BREAK

LANGUAGE IS AS CONFUSING AS A TRADITIONAL SYNTAX WOULD HAVE BEEN

A GENERALPURPOSE LANGUAGE THE THINGS IT SAYS SIMPLY ARE NOT VERY
COMPLICATED SO THERE’S LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR CONFUSION IN MOVING MEN
TALLY BETWEEN A TINY SUBSET OF ENGLISH AND THE ACTUAL CONTROL LAN

I THINK THERE MAY BE A WIDER LESSON HERE
 16WHEN YOUR LANGUAGE IS NOWHERE NEAR TURINGCOMPLETE SYNTAC
TIC SUGAR CAN BE YOUR FRIEND
ANOTHER LESSON IS ABOUT SECURITY BY OBSCURITY
SOME FETCHMAIL
USERS ASKED ME TO CHANGE THE SOWARE TO STORE PASSWORDS ENCRYPTED
IN THE RC FILE SO SNOOPERS WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO CASUALLY SEE THEM
IDIDN’TDOITBECAUSETHISDOESN’TACTUALLYADDPROTECTIONANYONE
WHO’S ACQUIRED PERMISSIONS TO READ YOUR RC FILE WILL BE ABLE TO RUN

THEY’D BE ABLE TO RIP THE NECESSARY DECODER OUT OF THE FETCHMAIL CODE
ITSELF TO GET IT

A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY TO PEOPLE WHO DON’T THINK VERY HARD

WHAT IT MUST NOT FAIL TO DO IS A RUN AND B CONVINCE
POTENTIAL CODEVELOPERS THAT IT CAN BE EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING REALLY
NEAT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
LINUX AND FETCHMAIL BOTH WENT PUBLIC WITH STRONG ATTRACTIVE BA
SIC DESIGNS
MANY PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THE BAZAAR MODEL AS I HAVE
PRESENTED IT HAVE CORRECTLY CONSIDERED THIS CRITICAL THEN JUMPED
FROM IT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A HIGH DEGREE OF DESIGN INTUITION AND
CLEVERNESS IN THE PROJECT LEADER IS INDISPENSABLE
BUT LINUS GOT HIS DESIGN FROM UNIX
I GOT MINE INITIALLY FROM THE
ANCESTRAL POPCLIENT THOUGH IT WOULD LATER CHANGE A GREAT DEAL MUCH
MORE PROPORTIONATELY SPEAKING THAN HAS LINUX
SO DOES THE LEADER
COORDINATOR FOR A BAZAARSTYLE EORT REALLY HAVE TO HAVE EXCEPTIONAL
DESIGN TALENT OR CAN HE GET BY ON LEVERAGING THE DESIGN TALENT OF
OTHERS
I THINK IT IS NOT CRITICAL THAT THE COORDINATOR BE ABLE TO ORIGINATE
DESIGNS OF EXCEPTIONAL BRILLIANCE BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT THE
COORDINATOR BE ABLE TORECOGNIZE GOOD DESIGN IDEAS FROM OTHERS
BOTH THE LINUX AND FETCHMAIL PROJECTS SHOW EVIDENCE OF THIS
LINUS WHILE NOT AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED A SPECTACULARLY ORIGINAL
DESIGNER HAS DISPLAYED A POWERFUL KNACK FOR RECOGNIZING GOOD DE
SIGN AND INTEGRATING IT INTO THE LINUX KERNEL
AND I HAVE ALREADY
DESCRIBED HOW THE SINGLE MOST POWERFUL DESIGN IDEA IN FETCHMAIL
SMTPFORWARDING CAME FROM SOMEBODY ELSE
EARLY AUDIENCES OF THIS PAPER COMPLIMENTED ME BY SUGGESTING
THAT I AM PRONE TO UNDERVALUE DESIGN ORIGINALITY IN BAZAAR PROJECTS
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF IT MYSELF AND THEREFORE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
THERE MAY BE SOME TRUTH TO THIS DESIGN AS OPPOSED TO CODING OR
DEBUGGING IS CERTAINLY MY STRONGEST SKILL
BUTTHEPROBLEMWITHBEINGCLEVERANDORIGINALINSOWAREDESIGN

IT’S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT I’M AN
ENERGETIC EXTROVERT WHO ENJOYS WORKING A CROWD AND HAS SOME OF

IN “THE MYTHICAL MANMONTH” FRED BROOKS OBSERVED THAT PRO
GRAMMER TIME IS NOT FUNGIBLE ADDING DEVELOPERS TO A LATE SOWARE
PROJECT MAKES IT LATER
HE ARGUED THAT THE COMPLEXITY AND COMMU
NICATION COSTS OF A PROJECT RISE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE NUMBER OF
DEVELOPERS WHILE WORK DONE ONLY RISES LINEARLY
THIS CLAIM HAS SINCE
BECOME KNOWN AS “BROOKS’S LAW” AND IS WIDELY REGARDED AS A TRU
ISM
BUT IF BROOKS’S LAW WERE THE WHOLE PICTURE LINUX WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE
GERALD WEINBERG’S CLASSIC “THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COMPUTER PRO

IN HIS DISCUSSION OF “EGOLESS PROGRAMMING” WEIN
BERG OBSERVED THAT IN SHOPS WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE NOT TERRITORIAL
ABOUT THEIR CODE AND ENCOURAGE OTHER PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR BUGS AND
POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN IT IMPROVEMENT HAPPENS DRAMATICALLY
FASTER THAN ELSEWHERE

THESE BECAME THE HOME OF INNOVATIONS THAT ARE LEGENDARY AND STILL
POTENT
LINUX WAS THE FIRST PROJECT TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS AND SUCCESSFUL
EORT TO USE THE ENTIRE WORLD AS ITS TALENT POOL
I DON’T THINK IT’S A
COINCIDENCE THAT THE GESTATION PERIOD OF LINUX COINCIDED WITH THE
BIRTH OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB AND THAT LINUX LEITS INFANCY DURING
THE SAME PERIOD IN 1993–1994 THAT SAW THE TAKEOOF THEISPINDUS
TRY AND THE EXPLOSION OF MAINSTREAM INTEREST IN THE INTERNET
LINUS
WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO LEARNED HOW TO PLAY BY THE NEW RULES THAT
PERVASIVE INTERNET ACCESS MADE POSSIBLE
WHILE CHEAP INTERNET WAS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE LINUX
MODEL TO EVOLVE I THINK IT WAS NOT BY ITSELF A SUCIENT CONDITION
ANOTHER VITAL FACTOR WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LEADERSHIP STYLE AND
SET OF COOPERATIVE CUSTOMS THAT COULD ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO ATTRACT CO
DEVELOPERS AND GET MAXIMUM LEVERAGE OUT OF THE MEDIUM
BUT WHAT IS THIS LEADERSHIP STYLE AND WHAT ARE THESE CUSTOMS
THEY CANNOT BE BASED ON POWER RELATIONSHIPS – AND EVEN IF THEY
COULD BE LEADERSHIP BY COERCION WOULD NOT PRODUCE THE RESULTS WE

CALLYECONOMICBUTISTHEINTANGIBLEOFTHEIROWNEGOSATISFACTIONAND
REPUTATION AMONG OTHER HACKERS
ONE MAY CALL THEIR MOTIVATION “AL

NURTURING INTEREST IN THE PROJECT UNTIL IT BECAME SELFSUSTAINING HAS
SHOWN AN ACUTE GRASP OF KROPOTKIN’S “PRINCIPLE OF SHARED UNDER

THIS QUASIECONOMIC VIEW OF THE LINUX WORLD ENABLES US
TO SEE HOW THAT UNDERSTANDING IS APPLIED
WE MAY VIEW LINUS’S METHOD AS A WAY TO CREATE AN ECIENT MAR
KET IN “EGOBOO” – TO CONNECT THE SELFISHNESS OF INDIVIDUAL HACKERS
AS FIRMLY AS POSSIBLE TO DICULT ENDS THAT CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY

HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE PRODUCTIVITY MULTIPLYING EECT OF CONVEN
TIONAL MANAGEMENT
TRADITIONALLYMINDED SOWAREDEVELOPMENT MANAGERS OEN OB
JECT THAT THE CASUALNESS WITH WHICH PROJECT GROUPS FORM AND CHANGE
AND DISSOLVE IN THE OPEN SOURCE WORLD NEGATES A SIGNIFICANT PART
OF THE APPARENT ADVANTAGE OF NUMBERS THAT THE OPENSOURCE COMMU
NITYHASOVERANYSINGLECLOSEDSOURCEDEVELOPERTHEYWOULDOBSERVE
THAT IN SOWARE DEVELOPMENT IT IS REALLY SUSTAINED EORT OVER TIME
AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH CUSTOMERS CAN EXPECT CONTINUING INVEST
MENT IN THE PRODUCT THAT MATTERS NOT JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
THROWN A BONE IN THE POT AND LEIT TO SIMMER
THERE IS SOMETHING TO THIS ARGUMENT TO BE SURE IN FACT I HAVE
DEVELOPED THE IDEA THAT EXPECTED FUTURE SERVICE VALUE IS THE KEY TO
THE ECONOMICS OF SOWARE PRODUCTION INTHE MAGIC CAULDRON
BUT THIS ARGUMENT ALSO HAS A MAJOR HIDDEN PROBLEM ITS IMPLICIT
ASSUMPTION THAT OPENSOURCE DEVELOPMENT CANNOT DELIVER SUCH SUS
TAINEDEORTINFACTTHEREHAVEBEENOPENSOURCEPROJECTSTHATMAIN
TAINED A COHERENT DIRECTION AND AN EECTIVE MAINTAINER COMMUNITY
OVER QUITE LONG PERIODS OF TIME WITHOUT THE KINDS OF INCENTIVE STRUC
TURES OR INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS THAT CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT FINDS
ESSENTIAL
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEGNUEMACS EDITOR IS AN EXTREME
AND INSTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE IT HAS ABSORBED THE EORTS OF HUNDREDS OF
CONTRIBUTORS OVER FIEEN YEARS INTO A UNIFIED ARCHITECTURAL VISION
DESPITE HIGH TURNOVER AND THE FACT THAT ONLY ONE PERSON ITS AUTHOR
HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY ACTIVE DURING ALL THAT TIME
NO CLOSEDSOURCE
EDITOR HAS EVER MATCHED THIS LONGEVITY RECORD
THIS SUGGESTS A REASON FOR QUESTIONING THE ADVANTAGES OF CONVEN
TIONALLYMANAGED SOWARE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE

ENTITLED TO WONDER WHAT IF ANYTHING THE TREMENDOUS OVERHEAD OF

OF LINUX DURING THE SAME PERIOD NOT ONLY ALONG THE INTEL LINE OF

MY FRIEND REPORTS THAT A LOT OFRESOURCE MARSHALLINGIS BASICALLY
DEFENSIVEONCEYOUHAVEYOURPEOPLEANDMACHINESANDOCESPACE
YOU HAVE TO DEFEND THEM FROM PEER MANAGERS COMPETING FOR THE
SAME RESOURCES AND HIGHERUPS TRYING TO ALLOCATE THE MOST ECIENT
USE OF A LIMITED POOL

INTEREST AND ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECTS THEY WORK ON AND

AND THERE IS LITTLE OR NO NEED FOR A MAN

ANYWAY IN A WORLD OF CHEAPPCS AND FAST INTERNET LINKS WE FIND
PRETTY CONSISTENTLY THAT THE ONLY REALLY LIMITING RESOURCE IS SKILLED AT
TENTION
OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS WHEN THEY FOUNDER ESSENTIALLY NEVER
DO SO FOR WANT OF MACHINES OR LINKS OR OCE SPACE THEY DIE ONLY
WHEN THE DEVELOPERS THEMSELVES LOSE INTEREST
THAT BEING THE CASE IT’S DOUBLY IMPORTANT THAT OPENSOURCE HACK
ERSORGANIZE THEMSELVESFOR MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY BY SELFSELECTION –
AND THE SOCIAL MILIEU SELECTS RUTHLESSLY FOR COMPETENCE
MY FRIEND

DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT IS A NECESSARY COMPENSATION FOR POORLY

I ADDRESS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SO
CIAL REASONS FOR BEING SKEPTICAL OF THIS CLAIM IN “HOMESTEADING THE
NOOSPHERE”
FOR PRESENT PURPOSES HOWEVER I THINK IT’S MORE INTER
ESTING TO POINT OUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF ACCEPTING IT AS TRUE
IF THE CONVENTIONAL CLOSEDSOURCE HEAVILYMANAGED STYLE OF SO
WARE DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY DEFENDED ONLY BY A SORT OF MAGINOT LINE
OF PROBLEMS CONDUCIVE TO BOREDOM THEN IT’S GOING TO REMAIN VIABLE
IN EACH INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION AREA FOR ONLY SO LONG AS NOBODY FINDS
THOSE PROBLEMS REALLY INTERESTING AND NOBODY ELSE FINDS ANY WAY
TO ROUTE AROUND THEM
BECAUSE THE MOMENT THERE IS OPENSOURCE
COMPETITION FOR A ‘BORING’ PIECE OF SOWARE CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
KNOW THAT IT WAS FINALLY TACKLED BY SOMEONE WHO CHOSE THAT PROBLEM
TO SOLVE BECAUSE OF A FASCINATION WITH THE PROBLEM ITSELF – WHICH IN
SOWARE AS IN OTHER KINDS OF CREATIVE WORK IS A FAR MORE EECTIVE
MOTIVATOR THAN MONEY ALONE
HAVING A CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE SOLELY IN ORDER TO
MOTIVATE THEN IS PROBABLY GOOD TACTICS BUT BAD STRATEGY A SHORT
TERM WIN BUT IN THE LONGER TERM A SURER LOSS
SO FAR CONVENTIONAL DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT LOOKS LIKE A BAD
BET NOW AGAINST OPEN SOURCE ON TWO POINTS RESOURCE MARSHALLING
ORGANIZATION AND LIKE IT’S LIVING ON BORROWED TIME WITH RESPECT TO
A THIRD MOTIVATION
AND THE POOR BELEAGUERED CONVENTIONAL MAN
AGER IS NOT GOING TO GET ANY SUCCOUR FROM THEMONITORINGISSUE THE
STRONGEST ARGUMENT THE OPENSOURCE COMMUNITY HAS IS THAT DECEN

THE
SPLIT ATTACKS ANOTHER PROBLEM THE DEADLINESS OF DEADLINES
WHEN
PROGRAMMERS ARE HELD BOTH TO AN IMMUTABLE FEATURE LIST AND A FIXED
DROPDEAD DATE QUALITY GOES OUT THE WINDOW AND THERE IS LIKELY A
COLOSSAL MESS IN THE MAKING
I AM INDEBTED TO MARCO IANSITI AND
ALAN MACCORMACK OF THE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL FOR POINTING ME
AT EVIDENCE THAT RELAXING EITHER ONE OF THESE CONSTRAINTS CAN MAKE
SCHEDULING WORKABLE
ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO FIX THE DEADLINE BUT LEAVE THE FEATURE LIST
FLEXIBLE ALLOWING FEATURES TO DROP OIF NOT COMPLETED BY DEADLINE
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE STRATEGY OF THE “STABLE” KERNEL BRANCH ALAN
COX THE STABLEKERNEL MAINTAINER PUTS OUT RELEASES AT FAIRLY REGULAR
INTERVALS BUT MAKES NO GUARANTEES ABOUT WHEN PARTICULAR BUGS WILL
BE FIXED OR FEATURES BACKPORTED FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH
THE OTHER WAY TO DO THIS IS TO SET A DESIRED FEATURE LIST AND DELIVER
ONLY WHEN IT IS DONE
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE STRATEGY OF THE “EXPERI
MENTAL” KERNEL BRANCH
DE MARCO AND LISTER CITED RESEARCH SHOWING
THAT THIS SCHEDULING POLICY “WAKE ME UP WHEN IT’S DONE” PRODUCES
NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST QUALITY BUT ON AVERAGE SHORTER DELIVERY TIMES
THAN EITHER “REALISTIC” OR “AGGRESSIVE” SCHEDULING
I HAVE COME TO SUSPECT AS OF EARLY 2000 THAT IN EARLIER VERSIONS

INAN ISSUE RELATED TO WHETHER ONE CAN START PROJECTS FROM ZERO

SOME CLAIM THAT LACKING STRONG LEADER
SHIP THE BAZAAR CAN ONLY HANDLE THE CLONING AND IMPROVEMENT OF
IDEAS ALREADY PRESENT AT THE ENGINEERING STATE OF THE ART BUT IS UN
ABLE TO PUSH THE STATE OF THE ART

THERE ARE SERIOUS ERRORS OF FACT IMPLIED IN THIS ARGUMENT
ONE
IS EXPOSED WHEN THE HALLOWEEN AUTHORS THEMSESELVES LATER OBSERVE
THAT “OEN  NEW RESEARCH IDEAS ARE FIRST IMPLEMENTED AND AVAIL

IF WE READ “OPEN SOURCE” FOR “LINUX” WE SEE THAT THIS IS FAR FROM

ON DEMAND
THEREFORE THE ROOT PROBLEM OF INNOVATION IN SOWARE OR ANY
WHERE ELSE IS INDEED HOW NOT TO SQUASH IT – BUT EVEN MORE FUNDA
MENTALLY IT ISHOW TO GROW LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN HAVE INSIGHTS IN THE
FIRST PLACE
TO SUPPOSE THAT CATHEDRALSTYLE DEVELOPMENT COULD MANAGE THIS
TRICK BUT THE LOW ENTRY BARRIERS AND PROCESS FLUIDITY OF THE BAZAAR
CANNOT WOULD BE ABSURD
IF WHAT IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON WITH ONE GOOD
IDEA THEN A SOCIAL MILIEU IN WHICH ONE PERSON CAN RAPIDLY ATTRACTTHE
COOPERATION OF HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WITH THAT GOOD IDEA
IS GOING INEVITABLY TO OUTINNOVATE ANY IN WHICH THE PERSON HAS TO
DO A POLITICAL SALES JOB TO A HIERARCHY BEFORE HE CAN WORK ON HIS IDEA
WITHOUT RISK OF GETTING FIRED
AND INDEED IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF SOWARE INNOVATION BY
ORGANIZATIONS USING THE CATHEDRAL MODEL WE QUICKLY FIND IT IS RATHER
RARE
LARGE CORPORATIONS RELY ON UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOR NEW IDEAS
THUS THE HALLOWEEN DOCUMENTS AUTHORS’ UNEASE ABOUT LINUX’S FA
CILITY AT COOPTING THAT RESEARCH MORE RAPIDLY
OR THEY BUY OUT SMALL
COMPANIES BUILT AROUND SOME INNOVATOR’S BRAIN
IN NEITHER CASE IS
THE INNOVATION NATIVE TO THE CATHEDRAL CULTURE INDEED MANY IN
NOVATIONS SO IMPORTED END UP BEING QUIETLY SUOCATED UNDER THE
MASSIVE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT THE HALLOWEEN DOCUMENTS’ AUTHORS
SO EXTOL
THAT HOWEVER IS A NEGATIVE POINT
THE READER WOULD BE BETTER
SERVED BY A POSITIVE ONE
I SUGGEST AS AN EXPERIMENT THE FOLLOWING
– PICK A CRITERION FOR ORIGINALITY THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN APPLY
CONSISTENTLYIFYOURDEFINITIONIS“IKNOWITWHENISEEIT”THAT’S
NOT A PROBLEM FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TEST

– PICKANYCLOSEDSOURCEOPERATINGSYSTEMCOMPETINGWITHLINUX
AND A BEST SOURCE FOR ACCOUNTS OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENT WORK ON
IT
– WATCH THAT SOURCE AND FRESHMEAT FOR ONE MONTH
EVERY DAY
COUNT THE NUMBER OF RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FRESHMEAT
THAT YOU CONSIDER ‘ORIGINAL’ WORK
APPLY THE SAME DEFINITION OF
‘ORIGINAL’ TO ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THAT OTHEROSAND COUNT THEM
– THIRTY DAYS LATER TOTAL UP BOTH FIGURES
THE DAY I WROTE THIS FRESHMEAT CARRIED TWENTYTWO RELEASE AN
NOUNCEMENTS OF WHICH THREE APPEAR THEY MIGHT PUSH STATE OF THE
ART IN SOME RESPECT THIS WAS A SLOW DAY FOR FRESHMEAT BUT I WILL BE
ASTONISHED IF ANY READER REPORTS AS MANY AS THREE LIKELY INNOVATIONS

SPOF COURSE KROPOTKIN’S CRITIQUE AND LINUS’S LAW RAISE SOME
WIDER ISSUES ABOUT THE CYBERNETICS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS
ANOTHER
FOLK THEOREM OF SOWARE ENGINEERING SUGGESTS ONE OF THEM CON
WAY’S LAW – COMMONLY STATED AS “IF YOU HAVE FOUR GROUPS WORKING
ON A COMPILER YOU’LL GET A 4PASS COMPILER”
THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT
WAS MORE GENERAL “ORGANIZATIONS WHICH DESIGN SYSTEMS ARE CON
STRAINED TO PRODUCE DESIGNS WHICH ARE COPIES OF THE COMMUNICATION
STRUCTURES OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS” WE MIGHT PUT IT MORE SUCCINCTLY
AS “THE MEANS DETERMINE THE ENDS”OR EVEN “PROCESSBECOMES PROD
UCT”
IT IS ACCORDINGLY WORTH NOTING THAT IN THE OPENSOURCE COMMU
NITY ORGANIZATIONAL FORM AND FUNCTION MATCH ON MANY LEVELS
THE
NETWORK IS EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE NOT JUST THE INTERNET BUT
THE PEOPLE DOING THE WORK FORM A DISTRIBUTED LOOSELY COUPLED PEER
TOPEER NETWORK WHICH PROVIDES MULTIPLE REDUNDANCY AND DEGRADES
VERYGRACEFULLYINBOTHNETWORKSEACHNODEISIMPORTANTONLYTOTHE
EXTENT THAT OTHER NODES WANT TO COOPERATE WITH IT
THE PEERTOPEER PART IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMUNITY’S ASTONISHING
PRODUCTIVITY
THE POINT KROPOTKIN WAS TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT POWER
RELATIONSHIPS IS DEVELOPED FURTHER BY THE ‘SNAFUPRINCIPLE’ “TRUE
COMMUNICATION IS POSSIBLE ONLY BETWEEN EQUALS BECAUSE INFERIORS
ARE MORE CONSISTENTLY REWARDED FOR TELLING THEIR SUPERIORS PLEASANT
LIES THAN FOR TELLING THE TRUTH” CREATIVE TEAMWORK UTTERLY DEPENDS
ON TRUE COMMUNICATION AND IS THUS VERY SERIOUSLY HINDERED BY THE
PRESENCE OF POWER RELATIONSHIPS
THE OPENSOURCE COMMUNITY EF
FECTIVELY FREE OF SUCH POWER RELATIONSHIPS IS TEACHING US BY CONTRAST
HOWDREADFULLYMUCHTHEYCOSTINBUGSINLOWEREDPRODUCTIVITYAND

FURTHER THESNAFUPRINCIPLE PREDICTS IN AUTHORITARIAN ORGANIZA
TIONS A PROGRESSIVE DISCONNECT BETWEEN DECISIONMAKERS AND REALITY
AS MORE AND MORE OF THE INPUT TO THOSE WHO DECIDE TENDS TO BECOME

THE WAY THIS PLAYS OUT IN CONVENTIONAL SOWARE DEVEL

HIDE IGNORE AND MINIMIZE PROBLEMS
