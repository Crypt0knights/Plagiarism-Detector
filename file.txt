 
The Vulnerable State of Yamuna river 
 
Objectives: 
 
●The primary focus of the research is to study and detect the variations in the 
pollutant concentration of the water found in the Yamuna & the Hindon 
river. 
●To draw the attention of policymakers & stakeholders of  India. 
●To make the citizens aware about the various policies & schemes adopted by 
the current Government of  India regarding preventing environmental 
pollution. 
●To critically analyse the working of the current government with respect to 
controlling river pollution. 
 
Introduction: 
 
The Yamuna​ is one of the most important rivers of India. At times, it was 
the lifeline for the people of the area, but today it is the most polluted river 
of the country and the part of the critically polluted stretch. River originates 
from Yamunotri at Uttarakhand & passes through Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar 
Pradesh. It merges with the Ganga at Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. The total 
length of Yamuna is 1,376 kilometres (855 mi) and has a​ drainage system​ of 
366,223 square kilometres. 
 
According to the Millennium Ecosystem assessment, the biodiversity of 
freshwater ecosystems has been degraded more than any other ecosystem, 
including tropical rainforests (Nema, 2007). Water pollution is a serious 
problem in India as almost 70 per cent of its surface water resources are 
contaminated by biological, toxic, organic, and inorganic pollutants.

In 1995, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified severely 
polluted stretches on 18 major rivers in India. Not surprisingly, a majority of 
these stretches were found in and around large urban areas. The high 
incidence of severe contamination near urban areas indicates that the 
industrial and domestic sectors’ contribution to water pollution is very high. 
 
“Surprisingly, though Delhi constitutes only 2% of the catchment area, it is 
responsible for 80% of the pollution of the rivers.” 
 
 
 
Thus, here we have compiled a report on the current pollution scenario of 
the rivers Yamuna & Hindon which play an important role in fulfilling the 
needs of the citizens of Delhi & its surrounding areas. Along with this, we 
have also critically analysed the working & steps being taken by the current 
Government in limiting the pollution levels and have jotted down the 
preventive measures that everyone must follow in order to put a check on the 
wastage and degradation of the natural resources. 
 
 
Background Survey: 
 
 
In order to collect information and gain a practical experience to analyse 
about the current standards of pollution in the Yamuna and Hindon rivers which 
flow through the Delhi NCR region, we visited - 
●Banks of  Yamuna river at Agra. 
●Banks of  Hindon river at Ghaziabad. 
We tried to look around the places near the banks to find any industry which is 
disposing off its sewage and hazardous waste in the river body and also

interrogated the locals around it regarding the changing state of the river and the 
reasons for the change according to them.
