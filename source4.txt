DREAMS Monday, 25 February 2019 ABSTRACT This article deals with the social issue of “Water Pollution”. I attempted to study on the topic by conducting a survey in the Muhamma locality in Alappuzha. Water pollution means the contamination of water bodies and occurs when pollutants are dumped directly or indirectly into water bodies without any proper treatment to remove harmful substances. For conducting the survey, I adopted the survey method. A questionnaire was prepared for this. From the data collected, I came to the conclusion that the region is severely affected by water pollution. The main reason behind the increasing water pollution is the lack of awareness among the common people. INTRODUCTION Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies. This form of environmental degradation occurs when pollutants are directly or indirectly discharged into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds. Water pollution is a major global problem which requires ongoing evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels. It has been suggested that the water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of deaths and diseases and that it accounts for the death of more than 14000 people daily. An estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness every day. Water in the cities is highly polluted and people have less access to safe drinking water. In addition to the acute problems of water pollution in developing countries, developed countries also continue to struggle with pollution problems. Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic contaminants and either does not support a human use, such as drinking water or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its constituent biotic communities.
