Patil, N V K Ramesh Paper Title: An Effiient AODV Routing Protocol for Vehicular Ad hoc Network Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is considered as a sensor network with special characteristics and some advance features. For VANET nodes treated with high mobility and fast topology change. These nodes can sense its neighboring area to provide various services like traffic monitoring, speed of vehicle and some environmental parameters monitoring. One of the advance reactive routing protocol is Ad Hoc on-demand Distance Vector (AODV) is most commonly used routing protocol in topology based routing. This paper is presenting improved AODV protocol, in order to consider different parameters like node mobility, sent packet rate, delay and throughput. Results are implemented using Network Simulator-2.
